title:  About Rick Jarrell
---

Iâ€™m a Product Manager with 10 years of experience leading product development in B2B media and software.

I also dabble in private investing with an eye toward Real Estate and Small Business.

Outside of work, I like to travel, snowboard, hike, and go on long walks with my dog.
