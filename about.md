title:  About Rick Jarrell
---

Iâ€™m a Product Manager with experience in B2B software and digital media. 

I'm fascinated by all things product, business, and finance, and share my infrequent musings here and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rick_jarrell_).

In my free time, I like to travel, snowboard, hike, and hang out with my dog.
