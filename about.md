title:  About Rick Jarrell
---
Iâ€™m a Product Manager with experience building digital media and software for a variety of industries. Right now, I'm building a messaging platform for the frontline workforce.

Other professional interests include real estate, investing, small business. Sometimes I pontificate about a mix of these things here and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rick_jarrell_).

In my free time, I like to travel, snowboard, hike, and hang out with my dog.
