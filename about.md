title:  About Rick Jarrell
---
Iâ€™m a Product Manager with 10 years of experience leading product development in B2B media and software.

I also dabble in Real Estate and Small Business investing to help reach my goals of financial independence and multi-generational wealth.

Outside of work, I like to travel, snowboard, hike, and hang out with my dog.
